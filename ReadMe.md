#What is this
A Ms Pac-Man controller homework.

##Task
Implement your own ghost team controller; try your best to minimize Ms Pac-Manâ€™s score. Note that Ms
Pac-Man may have various strategies.

##Guidelines
To develop a good ghost team, here are the steps that you might want to follow:
* Compile the source code in the package; make the game work on your own device;
* Browse into MsPacman/src/pacman/controllers/. Read the file controller.java and study how
Controller objects manipulate the game;
* Browse into MsPacman/src/pacman/controllers/examples. There you will find 3 example controllers
of ghosts: StarterGhosts.java, RandomGhosts.java, and AggressiveGhosts.java. Test and study
these examples; try to understand their strategies;
* Recall what you have learnt from the lectures. What do you think of those example ghost controllers?
Are they effective? Are they intelligent? What can you do to make them better?
* Implement and test your ideas; prepare for the submission.
